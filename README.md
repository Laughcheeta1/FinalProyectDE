# FinalProyectDE
The repository for the final project of Data Structures class

Team: 
Team Leader: Santiago Yepes Mesa

This final project consist of using the Huffman algorith to compress .txt files, using Java.
For this purposes we are making a basic Ui.

When you open the programm, it will automatically open the main page, this main page is going to contain 2 buttons, each of them is going to lead to another page, these two pages are:

    - Compress page: in this page you will be greeted by a text saying "Select The file to compress", under this, there will be a text - prompt that asks you to enter the memory direction of the file you want to compress, or if you dont know it, there will be a button to the right that opens the windows file searcher, so you can look for the file manually. 
    After this, you will be able to press the "check" button that is going to be under the text - prompt, this will open a file viewer, that allows you to see the file in question, and check if it is indeed the file you want to compress. To the right of the file visualization there is going to be another text - prompt that requires you to enter the memory location you are going to leave the compressed file in. After this, you can press the "compress" button, that will compress the .txt file, and save it in the desired location, with this, closing this file viewer, and returning you to the Compress page.
    
    - Decompress page: this page is escentially the same as the Compress page, the difference comes from the fact that when you press the check button, it will automatically decompress the file to be able to be watched in the file viewer. Once in the file viewer, the button instead of saying "compress", it will say "save", and this will save the decompressed version of the file, to the desired location.
